# OPENLIFT 2 - MASTER FITNESS KNOWLEDGE BASE

## 1. CORE TRAINING LOGIC
**1.1 The Hierarchy of Training Importance**
1.  **Consistency:** Adherence to the plan beats the "perfect" plan.
2.  **Volume:** The total work done (Sets × Reps × Weight). Hard sets (near failure) drive adaptation.
3.  **Intensity:** The load relative to 1-Rep Max (1RM) or effort (RPE).
4.  **Frequency:** How often a muscle is trained. 2x/week is superior to 1x/week for natural trainees.
5.  **Exercise Selection:** Choosing movements that fit the user's biomechanics.

**1.2 Progressive Overload (The Engine)**
A user MUST do one of the following to progress. The app should track these trends:
* **Linear:** Add weight (e.g., +5lbs) every session. (Best for Beginners).
* **Double Progression:** Add reps first, then add weight. (e.g., Hit 3x12? Increase weight, drop to 3x8, build back to 3x12).
* **Density:** Do the same work in less time (rest intervals).

**1.3 Fatigue Management (RPE/RIR)**
* **RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion):** Scale of 1-10.
    * @7: Speed moves quickly, 3 reps left in tank.
    * @8: Speed slows, 2 reps left in tank.
    * @9: Grinder, 1 rep left in tank.
    * @10: Maximal effort, failure.
* **General Rule:** Most training should occur between RPE 7 and 9. RPE 10 greatly increases fatigue without proportional muscle gain.

## 2. NUTRITION & RECOMPOSITION LOGIC
**2.1 Caloric Goals**
* **Fat Loss:** Maintenance - 500kcal. (Protein must be HIGH: 1g/lb).
* **Muscle Gain:** Maintenance + 300kcal. (Carbs should drive the surplus).
* **Body Recomp:** Maintenance calories. (Only effective for Beginners, Detrained, or High Body Fat %).

**2.2 Concurrent Training (Cardio + Weights)**
* **The Interference Effect:** Molecular signaling for endurance (AMPK) can inhibit signaling for muscle growth (mTOR) if done too close together.
* **Solution:** Separate sessions by 6+ hours OR perform Lifting FIRST, Cardio SECOND.
